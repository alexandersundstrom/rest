# REST

## Introduction
This repo based on Kotlin uses [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) to set up a template REST API. It 
has functionality for creating Users with permission as well as logging them in.

For logging SLF4J is used, and saved to file using the `logging.file` property. It rolls the log every day.

Models are managed using JPA (Java Persistence API) and ORM (Object Relational Mapping). For access to the database,
Spring
Frameworks [CrudRepository](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/data-commons/docs/1.6.1.RELEASE/reference/html/repositories.html)
is used.

Models are persisted in [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/). Spring Boot will create tables and column if they
don't exist.

[Annotations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_annotation) are used for springing up the entire application and
connects the models to the database.

All dependencies are handled using [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).

All endpoints accessed when logged in is passing through the `JWTFilter.kt`, where we check the JWT. This is set in
`ApplicationSecurity.kt`. When you log in a cookie is set with a JWT.

Each `User` can have permission. As this is a template, the permissions are not used, but should be tailored for the
specific application.

## Prerequisites

- Java SDK [Download here.](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
- IntelliJ [Download here.](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
- [Docker for Windows](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows)
  or [Docker for Mac](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac).
- Maven. `brew install maven` on Mac and `choco install maven`. ([Install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/index_sv)
  or [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/docs/installation) if you haven't already.)
- Optional: PGAdmin. [Download here.](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/)

## Getting started

- Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/alexandersundstrom/rest.git`
- Start the database:
  - `cd path/to/repo`
  - `docker-compose up -d`. (Run `docker-compose down` to shut it down.)
  - (Verify that it is running with `docker ps`)
- Some properties needs to be added for the Mailservice
  - When a user is created a mail is sent with a temporary password
  - During develop you can use a service like [Mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io/) to capture outgoing mail
  - Add a git ignored `application-dev.properties` under resources with the following properties:
  ```
   mail.from=
   mail.subject=
   spring.mail.host=
   spring.mail.port=
   spring.mail.username=
   spring.mail.password=
   spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.auth=true (depends on provider)
   spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.starttls.enable=true (depends on provider)
   ```
- Start the application, either:
  - In IntelliJ:
    - Open the project in IntelliJ
    - Click dropdown in top-right corner > "Edit configurations"
    - Click plus sign (`+`) in top-left corner > Select "Application"
    - Give the configuration a name (e. g. "Run app")
    - Click the three dots (`...`) next to "Main class" and select the class named `Application.kt`
    - Click "OK" to close the dialog and then click "Run" or "Debug" in the top-right corner.
  - Or from terminal:
    - `cd /path/to/repo`
    - `mvn clean package` (only first time and when changes has been done)
    - `java -jar target/rest-api-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`
- Visit [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html) to verify that you're done.
- The database starts up without any users. To log in and access endpoints you must first create a user, for this some
  code needs to be commented out in `JWTFilter`.
  - Basically comment out all code in the doFilter method, expect line 53 (chain?....)
  - Once the first user is created, stop the server, uncomment the code, and start the server again
  - This might be changed later on, but as this is just a template, this is fine for testing purposes

Optional: Inspect your database in PGAdmin

- Start PGAdmin (from Start Menu or Application Launcher)
- Right-click "Servers" and select "Create" > "Server"
- Give it a name (e. g. "rest-workshop")
- Click "Connection" tab
  - Host: localhost
  - Username: springbootuser
  - Password: admin

## Swagger

[Swagger](https://swagger.io/) is used for documentation and manual tests of the REST API. Check the Getting started
section for the URL once the application is started.

## Exceptions

If exceptions occurs (except in the `JWTFilter`), `RestExceptionHandler.kt` will handle it and return a ResponseEntity.
It's easy to add new exceptions for specific responses.

This way, the @RestController classes doesn't need any try catch blocks.
